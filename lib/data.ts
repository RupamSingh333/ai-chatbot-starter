Asian face, absolutely stunning, beautiful. Most of the Miss Worlds and Miss Universes are
coming from the other side of the world because look at the cheekbones on this. Katherine, how
old are you? 45. OK? She's beautiful, and I don't want to change anything of her beautiful looks.
We talked about a couple of things. I'm kind of curious to see, in a case like this where look how
much volume she has over here, if I can narrow her cheek with one injection. So we're gonna
take a look. I'm not sure. Look how much her eyebrow is above her orbital rim here, OK? She's
sitting about 1 centimeter.5. So I don't want to start injecting temple and pulling that up over
here. She's had her temples injected before, I believe you said that. Is that correct? Right. So,
I'm gonna feel for the orbital rim. I'm gonna draw a vertical line coming down over here. I'm
gonna take my cross link over here and I'm gonna put it somewhere, it's gonna be somewhere
about over there. She has a little flatness over there. I'm curious, OK? Look at the, the, the
hypercanthus or a little bit that we were talking about before, right? So I'm gonna take that
measurement over here, and I'm gonna see where I'm gonna fall over here, and it's about there.
OK, so she has a wider face, she's able to handle that. I'm gonna take a product, what do we
have? We haven't used anything that we should be using. We can use anything at all. Allergan,
give me the voluma then. We can take the voluma straight up. She's got Asian skin, so we eat
for the envelope is more on the thick side than on the thin side. I'm gonna use the pure product.
We're gonna use it. Pure. Why not? And we're gonna go and see if by just adding in a little bit of
product, and this is the actual wider side of the face, we're gonna see if we can change that
perception. I'm gonna try to fool you guys. I'm not sure we can do this, and I'm gonna do it in
two ways. The first thing that I'm gonna do, and I told her about this, and we'll continue your
treatments off camera afterwards. Don't worry, you're here, I'm gonna take care of you, OK? So
I'm gonna look for that point over here, Elevate the skin, take this out, I'm gonna use a 0.2
maybe instead of a 0.15, little stick, down to bone. How are you doing? Good, little aspiration.
We're gonna go ahead and we're gonna inject. You tell me if I'm hurting you. Everything's fine.
Check the glabella, look over at the skin, slow injection, product is going in. Beautiful. Nice and
slow. We're gonna release just a 1 millimeter, lift, look, I'm lifting like this. I can't go intravascular
like that, I don't think, and I'm putting in my second little bolus over here like that. And I'm trying
to create the light reflex. Nobody's bleeding in this place. What is it with these people in New
York? Only had one little drop of blood from David on that side, but otherwise, nobody seems to
bleed. I want you to tilt your chin up a little bit all the way. I'm gonna try to create the heart look
that everybody loves. OK, in the female face, I'll take the same product, please. I'm gonna do
the drop technique. I'm gonna line it up in the middle. She has nice height over here, so my
needle is gonna be in halfway or all the way. I want to project this way, OK? I wanna make her
look a little narrower. What I'm gonna try to do is create a light reflex over here that's gonna give
you the impression that her chin is a little bit more narrower heart shaped. Lift up. Flick. How
was that? Good. Surprised, huh? I'm against bone. I can't go back any further. I build a house
for the product, I start to inject. OK. Nice slow injection. Check the glabella, back to the skin.
Nice slow injection again. OK. And I'm gonna put in, we've used now about half a syringe of
voluma. I'm putting in a little bit more. Half a syringe total. Now I'm gonna put in about 0.5 total
on this, on this chin area over here. Beautiful, we're done. No bleeding. OK. And now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna use a little Arnica gel. She's had her teardrops in areas that are
anti-remedial, which she's had already injected. You can see what I've already accomplished
when she's lying like this, because I see light reflex here. I do not see light reflex over here

because it's sitting back over here somewhere. I hope we're gonna find out, we're gonna clean
this up. And we're gonna take a look and see if we, with less than a cc of product, if we can
have that magical effect. I'm not sure, but I'd love to find out if we made that face look narrower.
Boom. How do you like that? OK. It looks lifted, it doesn't look as cherubic over here the way it
is before, and you can see that she's looking. This was the wider side of the face, and it's
looking a little more narrow than that. This is what I do in the Asian face, in the, in the face that
has a lot of fat over here. I don't even go down to bone. What I do is I use it subcutaneous just
to create. This reflex right there, that's where the light is now. So if we go ahead and we tilt her
chin up all the way, OK, you can see that she has increased projection over here versus the
other side. The other thing that I wanted to do on her, I'll take the same product. OK? With a
fresh needle is what I think would be nice on her because the Asian face has a receded piriform
was to do her piriform region. So I'm gonna ask you to turn towards me a little bit. How are you
doing so far, Katherine? You're great. OK. So here we go. I hope I haven't hurt you too bad. This
is gonna be a little more sensitive, but I promise you it's not gonna be so bad. Where am I
going, guys? I'm behind her almost. Where am I aiming for? This commiss? This one. And how
close am I staying? I'm staying right on top of the edge of the eher base. I'm pulling the eher
base back. There we go. I gotta go down to bone. I'm feeling the bone. I can't go any deeper.
I'm aiming for there, OK? I'm injecting, you can aspirate if you like. And then we're injecting
slowly. I'm watching that alar base, I'm watching the tip of the nose. I'm watching the glabella.
OK. When Dan does his rhinoplasty. If he has to narrow a base, he's gonna go ahead and he's
gonna do what we call we excisions. Or he actually cuts out a wedge of skin and leaves a small
scar, which is imperceptible in his hands, I can promise you that. I'm not saying that this is
replacing that procedure. But I'm saying that this is something that we can do. To help our Asian
colleagues have less of a width of their nose. How am I doing here? I'm watching still. I haven't
got a clue how much I've injected, but I think I've injected probably around 0.2 or so. I'm at 02
now? OK. That's about what I like to inject. I'll take that little pad over here. How was that?
Good, good, good. Everything's good.
